Quick summary:

When the Vexed for Windows first starts there is an internal 
puzzle pack used which is basically Classic Level with one 
added puzzle.  Load puzzle packs with File-Open.  To start
Vexed for Windows with the last used puzzle pack click 
Settings-On Start Load Last, when checked it is active.

How to play

All user moves are horizontal and in the same row.

Left click down on a block, while holding down drag the mouse to 
 where you want the block to end up, then release the mouse to let 
 the block move.  The block does not move while dragging, it moves 
 when the mouse is released.
 
OR

Click on a block and release the mouse, then click on a destination
 and release the mouse, then the block will move.
 
Valid Moves
Playable blocks can only move into empty spaces in the same row
When a playable block moves over an empty space it falls down
When two or more playable blocks of the same type end up touching
 each other the blocks are evaporated.

Goal
Remove all blocks within 'par' or less, shown at the top of the window.

Enter a two (2) character puzzle number into the "Puzzle Number" box to jump
to that puzzle.  Number less then 10 are entered as 05 for example.

Puzzle Packs:
Vexed for Windows plays the same puzzle packs as the original Vexed.
A default puzzle pack 'Classic Level' is preloaded into the program
so just starting the program you can immediately play.

Other puzzle packs can be loaded from the Levels subdirectory under
wherever you installed the program.  Level packs will be released 
from time to time....

I did not invent this wonderful logic & thinking ahead puzzle game.
The original version 2.2 is on Sourceforge at http://vexed.sourceforge.net/.
There are also other versions on Sourceforge and the WWW.

Vexed for Windows is a 'cleanroom' code version of the original Palm Pilot
 version.  All code and consequentially all errors are mine not the original
 developers.  'Cleanroom' code means I did not refer to any developers code 
 to write this windows version of Vexed.  However, I did reference one text 
 file from the Sourceforge repository:
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/vexed/,level_pack_file_format.txt 
 to understand how the puzzles were encoded.  I also exchanged emails with 
 Mr. Mark Ingebretson who graciously answered a few questions.  In that file 
 is some javascript code for decoding the puzzles.  I used that as a basis 
 for decoding in the windows version with modifications to remove regex usage,
 and implement in C.
