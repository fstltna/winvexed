This is for the Vexed for Windows Beta release 0.7.5.2  12/07/2020

Download the ZIP or 7z file WinVexed.zip or WinVexed.7z

Unarchive the files in the installer archive to a known
location on your C drive.  For example extract the files
to C:\.  You can unzip it right over previous installations
if you want.  

Go to the directory you used and look for Vexed.exe
then double click on it.  That is it ;-) 

The install file contains a number of level packs.  Additional
level pack will be available later too.  It can be played without
opening a Level Pack since Classic Level is built it.

If installed at the top level C:\ the included shortcut can 
be dragged to your desktop, otherwise you'll create your own shortcut.

It is a work in progress but it is very playable with all original
Vexed for PalmPilot features/capabilities in release 0.7.5.1

Check back periodically for newer versions or bug fixes.
