Release Beta version 0.7.5

Help file context sensitivity could be implemented
Puzzle creator/editor to be implemented



------------------------
Initial Release Beta version 0.5.0

version 0.5.0 Beta
1) The program 'hangs' after a sequence 1st calling any of the help files
   then immediately calling About - The Loaded Puzzle Pack feature. 
   Weird, have not found connection - yet (DISABLED these until resolved)
   Read the files in the application directory using notepad or your favorite editor, for now.

2) Since this is a 'cleanroom' code version there is a small possibility that the block removal may
   not be exactly the same.  So far only one such case has been found in all the testing.  The difference
   is due to the sequencing of falling blocks. 

   In the original Classic Level pack the puzzle "I am Walrus" is an example.  Under my code this puzzle 
   can be solved in one move.  Column 6 row 5 move to Column 7 row 5.  However if you play this puzzle in
   with the original implementation code this solution won't work.  You will be left with one block in the
   far lower left.  

   In my version you can slow the movement down to see the exact path and matches.

   HOWEVER all solutions provided with the original puzzles work! :)
